# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and other property characteristics. The trained model is served as a REST API using FastAPI, enabling real-time price predictions.

The project follows best practices in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready API design.
